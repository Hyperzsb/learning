# Online Shop

This is a simple online shop application following the guide of [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course [Building Web Applications with Go - Intermediate Level](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-web-applications-with-go-intermediate-level/).

In this project, I am going to try to include as many modern techniques as possible, which may help me to build a solid foundation of how to develop a robust and scalable modern Web application.

## Libraries, Products and Services

This project uses various third-party libraries, products, and services beyond the standard Go library, including:

- Go libraries:
  - [github.com/go-chi/chi/v5](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/chi/v5)
  - [github.com/go-chi/cors](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-chi/cors)
  - [github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql)
  - [github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v74](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v74)
  - [golang.org/x/crypto](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto)
- Frontend libraries:
  - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- Services:
  - [Stripe](https://stripe.com/): It is an online payment infrastructure to manage the payment logic within this project.

## Philosophy

Although the overall architecture of this project follows the course's design, I will focus more on the general principles on building an effective application other than some tedious features (for example, the payment gateway using Stripe).

Anyway, working on this project is about learning fundamental knowledge about building a modern Web application.
