# Online Shop

This is a simple online shop application following the guide of [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course [Building Web Applications with Go - Intermediate Level](https://www.udemy.com/course/building-web-applications-with-go-intermediate-level/).

In this project, I am going to try to include as many modern techniques as possible, which may help me to build a solid foundation of how to develop a robust and scalable modern Web application.
