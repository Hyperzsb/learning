# Yet Another TinyKV

*NOTICE: As this project is at its very early stage, this doc will be gradually improved during the development phase.*

I am trying to build a similar distributed key-value storage system based on the [TinyKV](https://github.com/talent-plan/tinykv) project.
Some extra simplification, refactors and even features may be included in this project.
