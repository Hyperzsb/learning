# Gophercises

[Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) is a wonderful online course providing essential side project ideas for learning Go. 
The projects are properly designed from easy to hard, covering various Go concepts, packages, and libraries.

I am following this course to improve my coding skills using Go. By far, I think it is a good start for me.

## Projects

Here lists projects I have followed and completed in this course (in chronological order):

- [**quiz-game**](quiz-game): [project description](https://github.com/gophercises/quiz)
- [**url-shortener**](url-shortener): [project description](https://github.com/gophercises/urlshort)
- [**choose-your-own-adventure**](choose-your-own-adventure): [project description](https://github.com/gophercises/cyoa)
- [**html-link-parser**](html-link-parser): [project description](https://github.com/gophercises/link)
- [**sitemap-builder**](sitemap-builder): [project description](https://github.com/gophercises/sitemap)

## Libraries

There are many important standard libraries and packages used within these projects, including:

- [encoding/csv](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/csv)
- [encoding/json](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/json)
- [encoding/xml](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/xml)
- [flag](https://pkg.go.dev/flag)
- [fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt)
- [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template)
- [io](https://pkg.go.dev/io)
- [log](https://pkg.go.dev/log)
- [net/http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http)
- [net/url](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url)
- [os](https://pkg.go.dev/os)
- [strings](https://pkg.go.dev/strings)
- [time](https://pkg.go.dev/time)

And some widely-used third-part ones:

- [golang.org/x/net/html](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net/html)
- [gopkg.in/yaml.v3](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3)

I believe it is really necessary to get familiar with standard libraries before going on with other third-part libraries and frameworks.
But in scenarios for which there is no standard libraries designed, it is still essential to try some famous third-part ones.
