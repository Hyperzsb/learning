[Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) is a wonderful online course providing essential side project ideas for learning 
Go. The projects are properly designed from easy to hard, covering various Go concepts, packages, and libraries.

I am following this course to improve my coding skills using Go. By far, I think it is a good start for me.
