[Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) is a wonderful online course providing essential side project ideas for learning Go. 
The projects are properly designed from easy to hard, covering various Go concepts, packages, and libraries.

I am following this course to improve my coding skills using Go. By far, I think it is a good start for me.

There are many important standard libraries and packages used within there projects, including:

- [encoding/csv](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/csv)
- [flag](https://pkg.go.dev/flag)
- [fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt)
- [log](https://pkg.go.dev/log)
- [os](https://pkg.go.dev/os)
- [time](https://pkg.go.dev/time)

I suppose it is really necessary to get familiar with standard libraries before going on with other third-part libraries and frameworks.
