# Go

> "Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
> It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency."

## Table of Contents

*This table of contents is for this directory of this repo, not README itself. Anyway, this README is not too long.*

- [**gophercises**](gophercises): [Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) is a wonderful online course providing essential side project ideas for learning Go.
I followed this course and provided my solution to these projects.
- [**testing**](testing): Testing is so important in Go that I need to learn concepts and methods to write and run tests against my codes.

## Learning Resources

*Resources listed here are ordered by their value and importance.*

When picking up a new technique, I was always confused about where I should start first and what I should learn first, so the first thing I did when I decided to learn Go was searching for a roadmap.
And then I got this.
[Go Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang/) is a well-curated roadmap showing what should you learn at what phase.
You can follow these steps to dig into the Go in a reasonable way.
It also covers lots of well-known libraries and frameworks you need to use in your future study and work.

[Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com/) is a really, really good tutorial for beginners, covering almost every important concept of Go.
Most importantly, it has constant updates, which means you can learn new things after the new releases of Go.

[Gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) is a wonderful online course providing useful and meaningful side project ideas for learning Go.
Maybe the contents and solutions there are a little out of date, but it still provides some guidelines on how to become a "senior" (sort of) Go programmer.

If you like learning new things through books, you may find these [Go Books](https://github.com/dariubs/GoBooks) helpful.
This list includes many books, from entry level to advanced level, teaching you how to code in Go more efficiently, robustly, and securely.
