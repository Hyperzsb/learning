# Blockchain

> "A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.
> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). 
> The timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was created. 
> Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it. 
> Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks."

Blockchain, the key infrastructure of Web 3 ecology, has been attracting more and more attention in recent years.
As a passionate developer, learning Web 3 development is a really intriguing thing for me, but it still took some time to get started.
Fortunately, thanks to the project of my Master's degree, I finally have to learn it and start my journey in the world of Web 3.

## Frameworks

Due to the finanical nature of Blockchain and Web 3, developing and testing your code on the Mainnet of Ethereum and other production environment is extremely expensive.
Additionally, we also need basic SDKs and tools to facilitate our development process.
That is why we need frameworks.

There are some famous and widely-used frameworks you can try, including:

- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/): Hardhat is a development environment to compile, deploy, test, and debug your Ethereum software. Get Solidity stack traces & console.log.
- [Truffle Suite](https://trufflesuite.com/): Truffle is the most comprehensive suite of tools for smart contract development.
